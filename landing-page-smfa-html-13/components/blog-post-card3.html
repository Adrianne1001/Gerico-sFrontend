            One of the most pressing concerns is the dramatic fluctuation in
            meat prices. Prices have been on a roller-coaster ride for various
            reasons, including supply chain inefficiencies, outbreaks of
            diseases like African Swine Fever, and external market pressures.
            These fluctuations make it challenging for both consumers to afford
            meat and for producers to sustain their operations.

            The meat industry in the Philippines is facing a myriad of
            challenges that are causing concern among stakeholders, from farmers
            and producers to consumers and policymakers. These issues span
            across economic, social, and environmental dimensions, putting the
            long-term sustainability of the industry in question. This article
            delves into these multifaceted issues to provide an overview of the
            complex landscape of the Philippine meat sector. One of the most
            pressing concerns is the dramatic fluctuation in meat prices. Prices
            have been on a roller-coaster ride for various reasons, including
            supply chain inefficiencies, outbreaks of diseases like African
            Swine Fever, and external market pressures. These fluctuations make
            it challenging for both consumers to afford meat and for producers

            The increasing reliance on meat importation exacerbates the economic
            vulnerability of the local meat industry. While imports can help
            stabilize prices temporarily, they can also undercut local producers
            who struggle to compete with cheaper, imported products.
